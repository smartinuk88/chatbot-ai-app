-- ----------------------------------------------
-- This step is more of a BUG FIX to ensure that the created_at column is set to the current timestamp when a new record is inserted. 
-- We experienced a strange issue with this but usually its not necessary to do this.

-- Create the trigger function to set created_at
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION set_created_at()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  IF NEW.created_at IS NULL THEN
    NEW.created_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Create triggers for each table to set created_at
CREATE TRIGGER set_chatbots_created_at
BEFORE INSERT ON chatbots
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION set_created_at();

CREATE TRIGGER set_chatbot_characteristics_created_at
BEFORE INSERT ON chatbot_characteristics
